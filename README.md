## Technical Details
Fresh Money operates as a serverless function deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static and serverless deployment. The function is triggered by Zapier, a workflow automation tool known as "zaps." When the zap is triggered, it runs the Vercel deployment, but it adds the date to the end of the url.

For example this is the regular URL for the serverless function: https://money-flow-five.vercel.app/api/emaily
The zapier then adds the date and then it looks like: https://money-flow-five.vercel.app/api/emaily?date={{164673864__date_year}}-{{164673864__date_month}}-{{164673864__date_day}}


## Feedback and Contributions
Currently I"m working on making it so you can run it locally, the issue is the API key is not public. If you have any suggestions or encounter any issues, please feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository. I appreciate your involvement in making Fresh Money better for everyone.
